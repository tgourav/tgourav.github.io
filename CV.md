## **Bio**
Gourav Takhar is a PhD student at IIT Kanpur with a focus on "synthesis for security and bug finding." He has published research on security in esteemed conferences such as TACAS, CAV, ASE, HOST, and ICCAD. He also got a best paper award in ICCAD for his work in validating hyper-properties for system-on-chip designs. More recently, he has been working on synthesizing techniques for program verification, specifically addressing incorrectness logic. Additionally, Gourav has developed tools for learning program verification and testing.


## **Research Interests**
I  am interested in the Formal Methods domain. Following are some of the specific areas:

* Functional Synthesis for Logic Locking (used to stop Intellectual Property (IP) piracy).
* Function Synthesis for verification of buffer overflow safety properties of "Open Programs".
* Function Synthesis for bug detection in programs using Incorrectness Logic.
* Formal methods for co-verification of hardware (HW) and firmware (FW).

I am also interested in artificial intelligence for program verification, program testing, and hardware circuit design synthesis.

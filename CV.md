## **Bio**
Gourav Takhar completed his PhD from IIT Kanpur with a focus on "synthesis for security and bug detection." He has published research on security in esteemed conferences such as TACAS, CAV, ASE, HOST, and ICCAD. He also got a best paper award in ICCAD for his work in validating hyper-properties for system-on-chip designs. He has been invited to present his work on multiple platforms such as Academic Research and Careers for Students (ARCS) and Workshop on Research Highlights in Programming Languages (RHPL). More recently, he has been working on synthesizing techniques for program verification, specifically addressing Incorrectness Logic. Additionally, Gourav has developed tools for learning program verification and testing which has been used in the courses "Program Analysis verification and Testing" (PAVT, CS639) and last semester in "Compiler Design" (CS335) courses at IIT Kanpur.


## **Research Interests**
I  am interested in the Formal Methods domain. Following are some of the specific areas in which I have worked and am interested in working:

* Logic Locking (used to stop Intellectual Property (IP) piracy).
* Verification of buffer overflow safety properties of "Open Programs".
* Bug detection in programs using Incorrectness Logic.
* Co-verification of hardware (HW) and firmware (FW).
* Program analysis, verification and testing.
* Using LLMs in formal methods.
